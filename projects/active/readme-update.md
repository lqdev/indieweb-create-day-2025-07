# README.md Update Project

## Problem Statement

The current README.md is outdated and doesn't reflect the actual project structure and capabilities. It shows only initial "ideas" from the hackathon start, but the project has evolved into a comprehensive indieweb content management system with:

- Working markdown extensions for media-rich posts
- Systematic project management workflow
- Complete refactored F# codebase with proper architecture
- Documentation systems (backlog, changelog, daily logs)

Users and contributors need an accurate overview of what the project actually does and how to get started.

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Clear project description reflecting current capabilities
- [ ] Documentation of project structure and key directories
- [ ] Getting started instructions for running the system
- [ ] Link to project management workflow documentation

### Should Have  
- [ ] Examples of what the system can generate
- [ ] Technology stack overview (F#, Markdig, etc.)
- [ ] Brief architecture overview

### Could Have
- [ ] Contributing guidelines reference
- [ ] Link to changelog for project history
- [ ] Future roadmap overview

### Won't Have
- [ ] Detailed API documentation (belongs in separate docs)
- [ ] Complete setup instructions (should be in dedicated guide)

## Current State Analysis

**Existing README.md Issues:**
- Only shows initial hackathon ideas, not actual implementation
- No information about current project structure
- No getting started instructions
- Doesn't mention the comprehensive markdown extension system that's been built

**Project Structure to Document:**
```
├── markdown-extensions/     # Main application code
│   ├── script.fsx          # F# application entry point
│   ├── _src/               # Source markdown files
│   ├── _public/            # Generated HTML output
│   └── start-server.ps1    # Development server
├── projects/               # Project management
│   ├── backlog.md         # Feature backlog
│   ├── active/            # Active projects
│   └── archive/           # Completed projects
├── logs/                  # Daily development logs
└── changelog.md           # Project history
```

## Technical Approach

1. **Content Strategy**: Transform from "ideas" to "working system" focus
2. **Structure**: Follow standard README conventions (Purpose → Structure → Getting Started → Contributing)
3. **Tone**: Professional but accessible, showing this is a working system
4. **Links**: Connect to project management workflow and documentation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Content Overhaul
1. Update project description to reflect working system
2. Add project structure documentation
3. Add getting started instructions

### Phase 2: Enhancement
1. Add examples of generated output
2. Add technology stack information
3. Add links to project management workflow

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Verify all links work correctly
- [ ] Test getting started instructions on clean environment
- [ ] Ensure project structure documentation is accurate
- [ ] Validate that new contributors can understand project purpose

## Dependencies

- Access to current project structure
- Understanding of F# application entry points
- Knowledge of project management workflow

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk**: Making README too detailed and hard to maintain
**Mitigation**: Focus on high-level overview with links to detailed docs

**Risk**: Documentation becoming outdated again
**Mitigation**: Include update reminder in project completion checklist

## Definition of Done

- [ ] README.md accurately reflects current project state
- [ ] Getting started instructions work for new users
- [ ] Project structure is clearly documented
- [ ] All links are functional
- [ ] Content is professional and welcoming to contributors
- [ ] Document serves as effective project entry point
