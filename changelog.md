## 2025-07-05 - Order Tags Below Date Rendering Improvement ✅

**Project**: [Order Tags Below Date](archive/order-tags-below-date.md)  
**Duration**: 2025-07-05 (Single session)  
**Status**: Complete

### What Changed
Improved visual hierarchy by positioning tags below the date instead of side-by-side, creating clearer information flow in post headers.

### Technical Improvements  
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Clear progression from title → date → tags → content
- **Improved Readability**: Logical vertical information flow reduces cognitive load
- **Responsive Layout**: Vertical tag positioning handles varying tag counts better
- **CSS-Only Solution**: Clean implementation without structural HTML changes

### Features Added
- Vertical flexbox layout for post metadata (`.post-meta` CSS modification)
- Left-aligned date and tag positioning for consistent layout
- Optimized spacing between date and tag elements (12px gap)
- Enhanced visual organization across all post types

### Architecture Impact
Enhanced user experience through improved visual hierarchy while maintaining all existing functionality and semantic HTML structure.

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Minimal Impact**: Single CSS rule change achieved desired layout improvement
- **Maintainable**: Easy to adjust spacing or alignment in future iterations
- **Zero Regression**: No impact on existing F# code or HTML structure

- **Multiple Format Support**: Handles various ISO 8601 input formats with graceful fallback

### Features Added
- `DateUtils.formatDisplayDate` function with robust date parsing
- Support for timezone-aware date inputs (current) and various ISO formats
- Consistent date display across all post types (image, video, audio, mixed)
- Error handling with fallback to original format if parsing fails

### Architecture Impact
Enhanced user experience with cleaner date presentation while maintaining web standards compliance through proper datetime attributes.

### Code Quality Improvements
- **User Experience**: Improved readability with clean date format
- **Maintainability**: Centralized date formatting logic in dedicated utility module
- **Robustness**: Multiple input format support with graceful error handling

## 2025-07-05 - Remove Extra `:::` in Mixed.html Bug Fix ✅

**Project**: [Remove Extra Colons Bug](archive/remove-extra-colons-bug.md)  
**Duration**: 2025-07-05 (Single session)  
**Status**: Complete

### What Changed
Fixed markdown processing bug that caused extra `:::` fence markers to appear in generated HTML text content.

### Technical Improvements  
- **Clean HTML Output**: Eliminated `<p>:::</p>` artifacts from mixed media posts
- **Proper Fence Handling**: MediaBlockParser now correctly discards closing fence markers
- **User Experience**: Professional HTML generation without processing artifacts

### Bug Fix Details
- **Root Cause**: `MediaBlockParser.TryContinue` using `BlockState.Break` instead of `BlockState.BreakDiscard`
- **Solution**: Single-line change to properly discard closing `:::` fence markers
- **Testing**: Verified all four post types (image, video, audio, mixed) work correctly

### Architecture Impact
Enhanced markdown processing reliability by ensuring fence markers are consistently handled during parsing.

## 2025-07-05 - Markdown Processing System Refactoring ✅

**Project**: [Refactor Plan - Script.fsx Architecture](archive/refactor-plan.md)  
**Duration**: July 5, 2025  
**Status**: Complete

### What Changed
Complete architectural refactoring of the markdown processing system from monolithic functions to clean separation of concerns (Parse → Process → Render).

### Technical Improvements
- **Centralized Parsing**: All markdown processing consolidated into `MarkdownParser.parseDocument`
- **AST-based Processing**: Replaced error-prone string manipulation with proper AST traversal
- **Clean Architecture**: Implemented Parse → Process → Render pipeline with clear module boundaries
- **Type Safety**: Added structured error handling with Result types throughout pipeline
- **Performance**: Reduced from 3+ parse operations to 1 per post generation

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Before**: 48-line `generatePostHtml` with mixed concerns, string-based processing
- **After**: 3-line function using clean pipeline, AST-based processing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive Result types replacing exception-based handling
- **Module Organization**: Clear separation of responsibilities across specialized modules

### Features Added
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Consolidated markdown processing with AST-based text extraction
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Separated content processing from presentation logic
